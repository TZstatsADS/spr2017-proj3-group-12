+ Project summary: In this project, we tried to porpose a feasible improvement on the current classification engine for classifying grarscale images of poddle dogs versus images of fried chichen in terms of prediction accuracy as well as running cost, including memory, storage and time. The baseline model uses XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX on SIFT features. Our advanced model uses XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX on combination of XXXXXXXXXXXX features, which enhances the accuracy rate by XXXXXXX%.
