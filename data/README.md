# Project: Labradoodle or Fried Chicken? 

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

In addition, you can find various feature data sets in this flolder. The raw images we have for training is stored in "training data", under folder "raw_images". Gray images used for gray scale feature extraction can also be found in "bin_image" stored in "training data".
